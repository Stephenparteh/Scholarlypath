                                <p>As a Liberian from an underprivileged background,
                                    I understand the transformative power of education firsthand. My father's salary
                                    couldn't afford private university education in Liberia, yet pursuing scholarships
                                    and studying abroad shaped who I am today. It gave me the opportunity to study in
                                    the United States and earn my first Master’s in Public Policy at the University of
                                    Oxford. Now, I’m pursuing a second master's in Contemporary Education at Oxford on a
                                    full scholarship.</p>

                                <p>ScholarlyPath was founded by successful study abroad alumni with stories like mine,
                                    aiming to inspire and support others in realizing their dreams. Our flagship Study
                                    Abroad Symposium empowers Liberians by teaching them how to apply for global
                                    admissions and scholarship programs. Through storytelling and skill-building
                                    presentations, we expand knowledge on various application opportunities.</p>

                                <p>This Fall 2025, thousands of Liberians will pursue admission and scholarships. Our
                                    summit will empower and inspire them to be competitive and successful, serving as a
                                    platform for finding diverse scholarships and admission opportunities. We’ve seen
                                    this thrive in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and across Africa. For the past three years,
                                    we’ve inspired many with this platform.</p>

                                <p>We believe you can join this revolution. Partner with us to help promote global
                                    opportunities for Liberians. Our mission is to support and inspire them through our
                                    journey and the experiences of others. This will be our primary focus and energy
                                    until the month ends.</p>
